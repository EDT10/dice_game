This program starts with a initial high score of 0 and offers the user just two options.
if the user enters 1 the program rolls two dice and randomly generates two numbers representing the dice.
it adds the two numbers and compare it with the high score. If the high score is less than the new total, it displays the new total.
I got good practice playing around with python functions, modules and loops.
